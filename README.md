# PythonChatRoom
Create a Chat Room using Python and Google Drive

So what the "chat.py" file does it append the user input to the "messages.txt" file. You then use a cloud backup (such as google drive) to sync the the "messages.txt" with you friends.

Step 1:
Google Drive or some sort of cloud backup has to be installed and backing up a folder with both of the files in it.

Step 2:
You friend will also have to install the Google Drive or what ever backup you have choosen.

Step 3:
Share the folder that has the "chat.py" and "messages.txt" files in it with your friend.

Step 4:
Open the "chat.py" file and type in your username. After that you can view messages and reply.
